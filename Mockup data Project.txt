First, use SELECT * from both tables and use your knowledge of queries and aggregate functions to get to know the data:

--> 	SELECT * FROM PROGRESS;
	SELECT * FROM USERS;

What are the Top 25 schools (.edu domains)?

-->	SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE EMAIL_DOMAIN LIKE '%.EDU' LIMIT 25;

How many .edu learners are located in New York?

--> 	select city , count(user_id) as no_of_learners from users where city = 'New York'; 

The mobile_app column contains either mobile-user or NULL. How many of these Codecademy learners are using the mobile app?

-->	select mobile_app, count(mobile_app)from users;

Query for the sign up counts for each hour.

-->	select sign_up_at, strftime('%H',sign_up_at) from users group by 1;


Do different schools (.edu domains) prefer different courses?

-->     for javaScript  :
	 SELECT email_domain, COUNT(*) AS javascript
         FROM users 
         JOIN progress 
	 ON users.user_id = progress.user_id
	 WHERE progress.learn_javascript = 'started' OR progress.learn_javascript = 'completed'
	 GROUP BY 1
	 ORDER BY 1;
	
	for sql:
	 SELECT email_domain, COUNT(*) AS sql
         FROM users 
         JOIN progress 
	 ON users.user_id = progress.user_id
	 WHERE progress.learn_sql = 'started' OR progress.learn_sql = 'completed'
	 GROUP BY 1
	 ORDER BY 1;
	
	for html:
	 SELECT email_domain, COUNT(*) AS html
         FROM users 
         JOIN progress 
	 ON users.user_id = progress.user_id
	 WHERE progress.learn_html = 'started' OR progress.learn_html = 'completed'
	 GROUP BY 1
	 ORDER BY 1;

	for cpp:
	 SELECT email_domain, COUNT(*) AS cpp
         FROM users 
         JOIN progress 
	 ON users.user_id = progress.user_id
	 WHERE progress.learn_cpp = 'started' OR progress.learn_cpp = 'completed'
	 GROUP BY 1
	 ORDER BY 1;

	for java :
	 SELECT email_domain, COUNT(*) AS java
         FROM users 
         JOIN progress 
	 ON users.user_id = progress.user_id
	 WHERE progress.learn_java = 'started' OR progress.learn_java = 'completed'
	 GROUP BY 1
	 ORDER BY 1;
	
	

What courses are the New Yorkers students taking?

-->select * from users left join progress on users.user_id = progress.user_id WHERE city = 'New York';

What courses are the Chicago students taking?
-->	select * from users left join progress on users.user_id = progress.user_id WHERE city = 'Chicago';
