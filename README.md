# Codecademy Learners Mockup Data
## Overview
Analyze the Codecademy learner model data from two tables: users and progress is part of this project.
Learner information such as user_id, email_domain, nation, postal, mobile_app, and sign_up_at can be found in the users table.
Learners' progress in a variety of programming languages is monitored via the progress table.

      learn_cpp
      learn_sql
      learn_html
      learn_javascript
      learn_java

# Operation Perform 
1) Top 25 schools (.edu domains)
2) No of .edu learners in NY
3) No of learners using mobile app
4) Query for the sign up counts for each hour.
5) Join the two tables
  - Do different schools (.edu_domains) prefer different courses
